   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   Follow the prompts to configure your Amplify environment.

2. **Update API Endpoint**:
   After deployment, update the API endpoint in `index.html` with the URL from Amplify.

3. **Push to GitHub and connect to Amplify Console**:
   - Push your updated code to GitHub
   - Follow steps 2-5 from Method 1 to connect to the Amplify Console

## Local Development

You can run the site locally for development:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:3000

## Directory Structure

- `/` - Root directory with HTML, CSS, and config files
- `/images` - Logo and other image assets
- `/images/social` - Social media icons
- `/MarketingMaterials` - Marketing imagery used on the page
- `/amplify` - AWS Amplify configuration
- `/amplify/backend/function/subscribe` - Lambda function for email subscriptions

## Important Notes

- Make sure to update the API endpoint URL in index.html after deployment
- Never commit sensitive information like API keys to GitHub
- Test the form submission functionality after deployment
- This site uses a serverless function to handle form submissions to Mailchimp

## Troubleshooting

- **API not working**: Check that your environment variables are correctly set in the Amplify Console
- **Form submission errors**: Verify your Mailchimp API key and List ID
- **Styling issues**: The site is fully self-contained with inline CSS for simplicity
